# How to See Xcode Console (Debugger)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Make Sure App is Running

1. **Build and run** your app (click Play button ▶️)
2. **Wait for it to launch** in the simulator

### Step 2: Open the Console Panel

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (EASIEST)**
- Press **Cmd + Shift + Y** (all three keys together)
- This opens/closes the bottom panel

**Method 2: Menu**
1. At the top of Xcode, click **View**
2. Click **Debug Area**
3. Click **Show Debug Area** (or press Cmd + Shift + Y)

**Method 3: Button**
1. Look at the **bottom right** of Xcode window
2. You'll see a button with **two overlapping squares** or a **console icon**
3. Click it to show/hide the bottom panel

## What You Should See

Once the bottom panel is open, you'll see:
- **Left side:** Variables, call stack
- **Right side:** **Console** (this is what we need!)

The console shows:
- ✅ App logs
- ✅ Error messages
- ✅ Debug output
- ❌ Error details when things break

## How to See Errors

1. **Open console** (Cmd + Shift + Y)
2. **Try signing in** in the app
3. **Look at the console** - errors will appear there!

---

## If Console is Empty

The console only shows messages when:
- App is running
- Something happens (like an error)
- Code prints/logs something

**Try this:**
1. Open console (Cmd + Shift + Y)
2. Try signing in
3. Watch the console - errors should appear!

## Quick Reference

**Open Console:** Cmd + Shift + Y
**Close Console:** Cmd + Shift + Y (same shortcut)

## Alternative: Check Backend Logs

If you can't see Xcode console, I can help you check the backend logs instead. Just let me know!
