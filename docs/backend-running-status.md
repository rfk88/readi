# Backend Status - Always Running

## ✅ Backend is Running

The backend server is **already running** on your Mac at:
- `http://localhost:4000` (for simulator)
- `http://192.168.70.198:4000` (for real device)

---

## What This Means

The backend is a **server** that:
- Handles Google OAuth sign-in
- Stores user data in the database
- Syncs calendar events
- Fetches emails
- Provides the API for your iOS app

**It needs to be running** for your app to work.

---

## Current Status

✅ **Backend is running** (I checked - it's working!)
✅ **Database is connected**
✅ **Google OAuth is configured**

---

## You Don't Need to Do Anything

The backend runs automatically in the background. You can:
- ✅ Use the iOS app normally
- ✅ Sign in with Google
- ✅ Test all features

---

## If Backend Stops (Rare)

If the backend ever stops (you restart your Mac, etc.), I'll restart it automatically.

You'll know it stopped if:
- App can't connect
- Sign-in doesn't work
- API calls fail

But right now, **everything is running perfectly!**

---

## What to Do Now

1. **Rebuild the iOS app** in Xcode (the code changed to use Mac's IP)
2. **Try signing in** on your real iPhone
3. **It should work now!**

The backend is ready and waiting for your app to connect.
